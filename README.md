# Task Manager
## Motivation
I created this project in order to understand the important concepts of react like states, components, hooks etc.

## Features
- Users can add tasks and their deadlines.
- Users can also delete tasks.
- Every task has its corresponding id, deadline and also a checkbox showing the completion status.
- Upon refreshing the page, the data entered by the users will not be wiped off.
