# Task Manager
## Motivation
I created this project in order to understand the important concepts of react like states, components, hooks etc.
Later a backend has been added to this project.

## Features
- Users can add tasks and delete tasks.
- Completion status of a task can be toggled.
- Used mongodb database.
- Authorization using jwt, without which user cannot access the tasks page.
- Added input validation for email and password entry.
